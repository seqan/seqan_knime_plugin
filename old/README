    - 	seqan (a git repository for SeqAn)
     
    - KNIME_SDK=a path to a knime sdk
    
    - BASE_PLUGIN_PATH=a path to git repository for GenericKnimeNodes
    - SEQAN_SOURCE=a path to git repository for GenericKnimeNodes SeqAn
     
    - PLUGIN_CENTRAL_HOST=the host at which the plugins from several platforms will sent to
    - SEQAN_BUILD=directory at which seqan applications are built
